# NextJS Template

This is a minimal starter-configuration for the tech stack that I normally use.

The core stack includes:

-   Next.js
-   TypeScript
-   Tailwind CSS

For convenience, it also includes:

-   Prettier
-   ESLint
-   A basic Layout component
-   A useful template for a REST API route
-   A more neutral default tailwind CSS color scheme
